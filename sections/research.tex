\section{Research Experience}

\cventry{2021 - 2023}{Physics Researcher}{FSU Department of Physics}{Tallahassee, FL}{}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Programmed multiple numerical methods for solving the Schrödinger equation
		\item Calculated asymptotic normalization coefficients (ANCs) for nuclear core plus fragment
		      systems using radial wave functions obtained by solving the Schrödinger equation in a harmonic oscillator basis
		\item Analyzed the dependence of the ANC on Energy
		\item Explored the effect of Pauli blocking on ANCs by adding a norm kernel into the Schrödinger equation
		\item Studied properties of the norm kernel operator and its image in Hilbert space to understand the limits of the
		      model and determine where improvements can be made
	\end{itemize}
